/* This program defines a VU class with a calculatePay method that takes the base pay and hours worked as parameters. 
It checks if the base pay is less than the minimum wage or if the hours worked are more than the maximum hours, and prints an error message if either condition is true. 
Otherwise, it calculates the total pay based on the number of hours worked and prints the result. */
